# Body as Beat Instrument

[ NYU ITP - Machine Learning for Web week 3 homework. Based on Yining's Pose-Video+Music code. ]

Your body parts make beats when you place nose, left and right wrists, and right elbow inside randomly placed squares.
Refresh the page to re-generate squares' positions.

Similar to Twister game, I'd like to include all the body keypoints to play different beats. 
To gamify, more beats will add more points to the player.
