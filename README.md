# Body as Beat Instrument

[ NYU ITP - Machine Learning for Web week 3 homework. Based on Yining's Pose-Video+Music code. ]

Your body parts make beats when you place nose, left and right wrists, and right elbow inside randomly placed squares.
Refresh the page to re-generate squares' positions.

Playing 4 different beats with nose, both wrists and right elbow.

Moving forward, I'd like to add different beats for each keypoint of the body.
